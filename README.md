###### Objective
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

###### User Stories
* I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
* When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

###### Hint
* You may want to use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
